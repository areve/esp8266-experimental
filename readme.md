# ESP8266-experimental

This project comprises some of my experiments on an ESP8266-12. The project is called **Moth**, maybe I'll get my ESP8266 to fly one day, for now it's attached to a breadboard and I'm making it
serve web pages and turn motors and lights on and off etc.

If you find the source useful do let me know.

## Development

I develop in Visual Studio with the Visual Micro Add on, but the project should
also work in the Arduino IDE.
